# Copilot Instructions for walk-talk (QR Slot MVP)

## Project Overview
This is a static MVP for GitHub Pages to quickly measure interest in time slots via QR codes. No personal data is collected. The main workflow is users clicking a slot button, which is logged for analytics or sent to Google Sheets.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main slot selection UI and core logic. Configure slots and logging here.
- `thanks.html`: Simple thank-you page after slot selection.
- `readme.html`: Project documentation and setup instructions.
- `apps_script_code.gs`: Google Apps Script for logging clicks to Google Sheets.

## Architecture & Data Flow
- **Slot selection**: Users select a time slot from buttons generated by the `SLOTS` constant in `index.html`.
- **Logging**: Three modes:
  - `LOG_MODE="none"`: Logs to browser console for quick field tests.
  - `LOG_MODE="apps_script"`: Sends POST requests to a Google Apps Script endpoint (`LOG_ENDPOINT`).
  - Analytics (Plausible/GA): Optionally redirect to `thanks.html?slot=...` for pageview tracking.
- **Customization**: Slots and page title can be changed via constants or URL query parameters.

## Developer Workflows
- **Deploy**: Copy all HTML files to a new repo, enable GitHub Pages (root folder, main branch).
- **Change slots**: Edit the `SLOTS` array in `index.html`.
- **Enable logging to Sheets**: Deploy `apps_script_code.gs` as a web app, set `LOG_ENDPOINT` and `LOG_MODE` in `index.html`.
- **Analytics**: Add analytics script in `<head>` and enable redirect after click.

## Project-Specific Patterns
- Minimal JS, all logic in `index.html`.
- No build step, no dependencies.
- Logging is opt-in and privacy-focused.
- Page title can be set via `?title=...` query param for A/B tests.

## Integration Points
- **Google Sheets**: See `apps_script_code.gs` and README for setup.
- **Analytics**: Add Plausible/GA script as needed.

## Examples
- To add a new slot: `const SLOTS = ["18:00","19:00","20:00"]` in `index.html`.
- To log to Sheets: Set `LOG_MODE="apps_script"` and provide your Apps Script endpoint.
- To run A/B tests: Use different URLs or query params for QR codes.

## References
- See `readme.html` for step-by-step setup and usage details.
- All logic is in `index.html` for easy review and modification.
